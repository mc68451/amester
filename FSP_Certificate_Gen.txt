Step 1: Generate a Private Key 
I used 2048 but either should work.

xyz.key  NOTE: using passphrase.

xyz.pkp text of the passphrase used.

 

Step 2: Generate a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) 

xyz.crs

 
Step 3: Generating a Self-Signed Certificate 

xyz.crt

 

amester: start in same directory as Crypt files, else you have to put path in.
