Automated Measurement of Systems for Temperature and Energy Reporting
is a software tool to remotely collect power, temperature, fan speed,
and performance data from IBM servers and control power management
policies in those servers.  It has interfaces for BladeCenter, POWER,
and x86 rack-mount systems.  It provides functions to 1) download and
graph sensors, 2) read and write any named variables in EnergyScale
firmware, 3) Collect 1 ms resolution traces on any sensor or named
variable, 4) collect 32 ms resolutions traces on SCOM addresses and
correlate them with sensors and named variables, and 5) control remote
jobs to be run on servers. The user can control the tool by writing
scripts in the popular TCL language to automate the operation modes of
the server and collection of data. The tool can attach to multiple
servers simultaneously to enable cluster-level power management
studies.

---------------------
Installation on Linux

Step 1: Download the program from the website
     https://github.com/open-power/amester
Step 2: At the Linux prompt, inside the amester directory
     Type "./configure"
     Type "make"
     Watch the tool build.
Step 3: Run the program in the build directory
     Look in the directory amester/build/ for the binary executable.
     Alternately, you can run directly from the source code by
     typing "run.tcl"

   When the network or system recovers, this means there are fewer old messages in the queue
   to process.
-- Make POWER8 initial connection only succeed when all OCCs on a node respond. Previously,
   any OCCs that did not respond were silently ignored.

      add_node_gui_menu
    Removed "Options", "Power Control", and "Performance Control" functions (P8
    system only.)

---- Update tool initialization to for API 5.25 so that it does not request
     the histogram snapshot rate for each sensor when the current value is 0.
     The development TPMD has not set the proper value (should be non-zero),
     but this version of tool will deal with it no matter what value it has.

-- Fix bug since 5.22 that caused sensors GUI to fail on older firmware.  (Sensor update field was initialized to "" instead of 0 and could not be incremented)
-- Remove spurious "after" output. (Put "return" at end of sensor_window_update routine so after is not the last line)

Changes in version 5.23  2009-08-06
-- Make sensor GUI more responsive.

--- Add Parameter interface
--- Add parameters to trace interface

Changes in version 5.18

-- Add get_control_a_sync to get classic P control model parameter
-- Fix bug that caused error when --no-gui is used (tried to add menu items to connect to hosts)
-- Only start amester scope if there the GUI is running. (Otherwise setting the address of a host opens scope
   and causes hang when --nogui is used)
-- Standardize output of ipmicmd across all hosts to print a 2 character hexidecimal completion code for IPMI command when code is non-zero.

Changes in version 5.14
-- Fix bug causing all output to freeze until sensor window was displayed.
-- Fix bug causing nothing to happen when a "select" button is clicked.
   (Converted multiselect windows to itcl to enable multiple multiselects

   (Enforce CVS commit before making a release)

Changes in version 5.12
-- Fixed a bug that caused no sensors to be displayed on systems with more than 128 sensors.
-- Add a GUI to connect to common machine types. On File menu under "Connect to..."

Changes in version 5.11

   - Update GUI for sensor windows
     - Add scrollbars
     - Use a large fixed-size format for some fields to remove "wiggle" problem.
-- Add EMT agent program.  tool connects over TCP/IP to agent running in-band that
   can reply IPMI commands to platform.  This gives a high-speed way to interact with blades
   which are bottle-necked by a single BladeCenter MM using a slow RS485 bus.
-- Turned off debug messages for netc interface. It is considered stable.

Changes in version 5.10
-- AME v2.16 changes
   - Add GUI for controling AME performance parameters
    (manual override and speed setpoint)
   - Add many *_sync access methods for power control parameters which wait
     until IPMI command has finished before returning.
   - Add many *_get access methods to return AME object variables.  These synchronize
     with the AME firmware and return the most recent value in the firmware.
-- Add bc::get_ambient_temp_sync to return ambient temperature from management module.
-- Add netc object for accessing AME functions on HV8 systems
-- Fixed errors that resulted in spurious debug messages being printed.
   (related to MM hangup after timeout and commandline window callbacks.)

-- If a new server is the same type and firmware level, assume
   it has an identical sensor configuration (Reduce number of
   IPMI commands when tool connects)
- Added scrollbars to main window
- Choose unique color/dash/symbol patterns for each server for
  cluster-level graphs.

Changes in version 5.7
- Add commands for set/get speed setpoint
- Add commands for set/get of performance state override.
- Add manual for AME IPMI 2.15.  (new commands for 2.15 only)

- New command interface to send IPMI messages to hosts.

Changes in version 5.2
- Add localhost object.  Use this to connect tool to AME running on the local system.
- Restructure code: both blade and localhost use ame and sensor objects (contains).
- Restructure code: Move IPMI and ameutil code to host object

Changes in version 5.1
